## Task 1    

## Introduction:  

In this assignment, you are to write a program that will print an ASCII art drawing of a diamond in a picture frame that will be displayed on the screen of your Android device in a text box. You should exactly reproduce the format of the output samples in the attached PDF file below. A major part of this assignment is showing that you understand for loops and if statements.  
  
## Learning Outcomes:  
After completing this assignment, you will have experience with:  
  
Writing loops that repeat some computation a specified number of times based upon a received parameter.  
Writing conditional statements that alter the execution of your program based upon various criteria.  
Writing methods that accept parameters to eliminate or reduce redundant code in your program.  
Task:  
See the attached document for complete details.  

## Task 2    
## The Birthday Problem - Auto Graded  

## Introduction:  
In probability theory, the birthday problem concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 366 (since there are 365 possible birthdays, excluding February 29th). It would seem that we would need 183 people (half of 365) to reach a 50% probability. However, 99% probability is reached with just 57 people and 50% probability with just 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  
  
## Learning Outcomes:  
After completing this assignment, you will have experience with:  
  
Using structured data to hold a whole collection of data values.   
Designing a solution to a larger problem and choosing the best data structure for that design.  
Performing a simulation using randomly generated data.  
Creating a cumulative sum loop to count things.   

## Resources:  
Please download the supplied zip file available with this specification. Extract the files onto your computer. The extracted files contain an Android Studio project. Start Android Studio and open the project.  All your work for this assignment will be in the file Logic.java. Open this file in the IDE and look for the comment:
  
// TODO -- add your code here   
  
As you do your work, be sure to place all your code in the Logic class.  
  
This comment is located inside the calculate() method. The calculate() method takes in two parameters: the size of the group of people, and the count of the number of simulations to run. The method returns a value of type double that represents the percent of the simulations that had two people with the same birthday.  If/when you add helper methods, be sure to place them in the Logic class after the calculate() method.
